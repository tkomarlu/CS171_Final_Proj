# CS 176 Final Project
This project implements multi-paxos for consesus as well as a simplified blockchain model for record keeping.

# Setup
Run the script runLocally.sh. This bash script creates 5 Servers and 3 Clients. You can simulate network failures using faillink and simulate process failures using failprocess. 
The servers communicate with the clients to manipulate an append only key value store and a blockchain that stores the operations performed on the key value store.
